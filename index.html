				<p>Hey Byoung, you are a really good friend and I will forever miss you. We have only known for a year and half and it felt like I have known you since forever. I remember the first time we met, you asked me how do you login on the school computer. In my head, I was like this kid is not going to go far. But you proved me wrong with how hard you work and I really admire you. I hope you reach great height in whatever you do and I wish you the best. Sorry I won't be able to drink with you and puke everywhere. Next time we meet I'll try and outdrink you. Thank you for being part of my life, we will meet again one day 형!</p>

				<p>Hey 병. I appreciate what a great friend you have been over the small amount of time I have known you. I hope that I will be able to visit you within the next two years! Pictures are always the best way of studying is what a wise man once told me.

				<p>Hi Byoung, thank you for being an amazing friend. I would like to thank you for inviting me to so many different kinds of events. I appreciate it, this allowed me to become more outgoing and I was able to make friends. I respect you from the bottom of my heart, I look up to you and strive to become a fraction of the person you are. I hope to repay your kindness in the future. I will miss you very much. If either of us is in Korea or Montreal and I hope that we can connect and hang out.</p>

				<p>Hello Byoung. Thank you for being my friend and study buddy. When I was a beginner here in Montreal I felt disconnected to everything and you helped me a lot with orienting myself. That means a lot to me and I won’t forget such a nice person. It was interesting and inspiring to listen to you because you always have an optimistic attitude and other good qualities. It made me sad when I knew your leaving but I’m pretty sure you will have a promising future.

				<p>Hey Byoung! I am very happy for being your friend. During the past one year, I have been invited by you to a lot of amazing parties, and meet many new friends. This is my second year in Montreal, and it’s you who helps me have a deeper understand of this city. I hope you will have a memorable experience during your military service, and I believe you are bound to have a good future.</p>
